# Enterprise Observability Automation Framework

### 🚀 Business Value
This toolkit is designed to accelerate Dynatrace v3 adoption for large-scale enterprises. It focuses on shifting from manual operations ("ClickOps") to a fully automated, code-driven observability strategy.

**Key Capabilities:**
* **Cost Reduction:** Optimize Grail ingestion pipelines to reduce DDU consumption by ~40%.
* **Speed:** Deploy standardized monitoring for 100+ microservices in minutes using Monaco v2 templates.
* **Governance:** Audit trails and version control for all Dynatrace configurations.

### 📂 Repository Structure
* `/monaco-v2-pipelines`: Templates for automated configuration deployment (Management Zones, Alerting Profiles, SLOs).
* `/grail-dql-library`: Advanced DQL queries for Business Analytics and Security forensics.
* `/automation-scripts`: Python/Bash utilities for API interactions and mass-updates.
